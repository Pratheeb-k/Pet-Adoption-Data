# Pet Adoption Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pet adoption data to understand trends, identify factors that influence adoption rates, and uncover insights to improve the likelihood of successful adoptions. The goal is to support shelters and organizations in optimizing their processes and strategies for finding homes for pets.

## Dataset
The dataset contains detailed information about pets available for adoption, including:
- **Pet Information**: ID, name, type (dog, cat, etc.), breed, age, color, and size.
- **Adoption Details**: Adoption status, time to adoption, and associated fees.
- **Health Information**: Vaccination status, spay/neuter status, and medical conditions.
- **Shelter Information**: Shelter ID, location, and capacity.

### Data Source
[Add details about where the dataset was sourced, e.g., PetFinder, Kaggle, or custom collected data.]

## Objectives
1. **Explore Adoption Trends**: Analyze trends over time (e.g., seasonality, popular pet types).
2. **Identify Key Factors**: Determine attributes that most influence adoption rates.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to predict the likelihood of adoption within a specific timeframe.
4. **Visualizations**: Create dashboards to present insights to stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau/Power BI
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (if applicable)

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Adoption rate prediction
- Insights into optimal pricing strategies for adoption fees
- Recommendations for improving adoption processes

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pet-adoption-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis scripts or open the dashboard files.

## Results
Key findings and model performance metrics will be documented in the `results` folder. A summary of insights will be shared in the project presentation or final report.
